# Hearne Photos

![image of my website]()

Hearne Photos is a website where my Father will be able to sell the photos he has taken over the years during his walking trips.

I got the idea from the fact my Father has thousands of photos on his hard drive and its was a shame that not of them would ever been seen by anyone so I thought it would be nice show them off on a website with an option to buy.

This is my fourth of four milestone projects that make up my Full Stack Web Development course at THE CODE INSTITUTE. The main requirements are to make a responsive website with HTML5, CSS3, Java Script, Python, Stripe payments, relational databases and additional libraries.

Here is the link to my live website : 

# UX

## Main aims

- To provide an easy experience for the users so that can view photos easily.
- To allow users to be able to purchase photos easily.
- To create a responsive website that can be used on tablets and phones.
- To create a website that can be navigated easily and not being difficult to use so that the user is not frustrated.
- To create a website that has a consistent menu and theme that is very clear at getting all of the information across.

# User Stories

## New Users

- I am a new user who wants to be able to have a look at just photos from the North East as I am from here.
- I am a new user who wants to be able to search for photos from certain areas.

## Returning User

- Store owners want to be able to edit already made photos.
- Store owners want to be able to add and remove photos.

## Tablet User

- I am a tablet user and I was able to use the website correctly on my tablet.

# Design Procces

1. Strategy plane : When planning on what I wanted my Hearne Photos website, I wanted to make a website that was easy to navigate and clear and representing all of the photos clearly to the user. I didn't want the website to be complicated, I wanted to make it be user friendly. I asked a few friends and family one what would be a suitable display and theme to meet these goals.

2. Scope plane : Now that I had planned what I was going to do with my website, I then needed to plan what sort of features I wanted to add to the website. For the photos I decided to make card panels to show the photos. I also made a search function so that I was able to search through the photos by location. I made drop down boxes on the main page to be able to filter the photos by price.

3. Structure plane : For the structure of the website my first made it so that the user will encounter the homepage with a lovely photo showing what my Father's photography is about, also giving the user links to the other shopping pages, the login and register pages before going into the rest of the site. Users will be able to go to the shopping basket it too.

4. Skelton plane : To navigate the Hearne Photos website there will be a simple navigatation bar at the top of the page on every page. I thought this was best as it meant it was easy to navigate through the website with no issues and is very clear.

5. Surface plane : For the look of the website I decided on a simple theme of white and black. I did not want the colours to take away from the website as the main reason for the website was to present lovely photos and at the same time I didn't want the website to look to bland.

Now that I had planned all of this and had a good picture in my head of what I wanted to do I went on the figma to start designing my website.

# Wireframing my project on Figma 

To make sure that I fully understood what me website was going to look like before creating the website I created my layout on Figma. This give me an idea on what I was going to do and what tools I would be using.
