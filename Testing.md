Testing

The testing process I went through is listed below:
- Testing user stories.
- Validating the code.
- Checking if the website is repsonsive.
- Manually testing the websites features.

Testing user stories

New users :
- This user is able to do exaclty what they asked, they are able create reviews and see other reviews. 
- The user is able to search through each review using a filter being able to searchfor genre, author or film name.
Returing users:
- Returing users are able to edit their reviews which is what the user wanted.
- Returing users are able to delete their own reviews if they don't like them which is what the user wanted. 
Tablet user:
- The website is fully repsonsive on tablets and phones so this user will be able to use the website fine.

Manual Testing

- I went through each of the buttons in the task bar from each page to make sure they worked.
- To test the site bar I made sure to go through each page using all the buttons from each page.
- For the editing buttons on the reviews I made sure to edit them so that I could see that the edit button worked correctly.
- I added and deleted revuews to test that the button worked. I checked the database to see that they were actually deleted.
- I created numerious reviews using the create review page to make sure the functionality worked correctly and checked that they got added to the database.
- I registered multiple users using the registration page to test that the register page worked correctly and sent the emails correctly.
- I logged in and out multiple times with different users to make sure that the log in screen worked.
- I tried to log in with incorrect user details to make sure that the python checked to see if the user exsisted and had the correct password.
- I have tried to register with usernames that have already been take to make sure that I can't make users with the same username.
